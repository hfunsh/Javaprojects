/*This program will prompt the user to Enter the following Payroll related information
 * Employee Name
 * Number of Hours worked
 * Hourly Pay rate
 * Federal Tax Withholding
 * State Tax withholding
 * 
 * The system will then generate a Payroll statement which will print the entered information, along with pay and tax information. 
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * Employees name: Fred Smith
 * Hours worked: 10
 * Pay Rate: $6.75
 * Gross Pay: $67.5
 * Deductions:
 * Federal Withholding(20.0%): $13.5
 * State Withholding(9.0%): $6.075 
 * Total Deductions: $19.575
 * Net Pay: $47.925
